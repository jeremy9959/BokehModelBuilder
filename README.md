## BokehModelBuilder

![](.bokeh_sample.png)

[bokeh](http://bokeh.org) is a library for generating interactive graphics and dashboards in python. 
Every component offers a myriad of customizing options, and I find it impossible to keep track of them.
This tool (very much under development) offers a graphical interface to those options. I imagine the user
working with this tool to prepare a plot format that they like, and then obtaining code from the tool
that they can include in whatever bokeh project they are working on.
